Java Pro learning expectations

Hi, everyone!'
'
My name is Pavlo Pashchevskyi. I am attending the JavaPro course in Hillel school.

I expect from this course that I will work professionally with Java and related technologies and in the future get a job in the financial field with interesting projects.
